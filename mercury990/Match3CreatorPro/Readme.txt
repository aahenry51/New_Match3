Match3 Creator

//IMPORTANT!//////////////////////////
//Camera MUST be in Orthographic Projection to work properly.
//Must Have DOTween (HOTween v2) tween service. 


///Quick Tutorial/////
-After importing Match3 Creator and DOTween, create a canvas. Add a gameobject to the canvas and add a new script.
Open the script and add "using Match3Engine" namespace. Make sure the camera is in orthographic projection.
The namespace uses gameobjects typically with image components to place on the grid.

///Scripting
//With the Scripting setup you can use the following namespaces
-"GridSetting"	: General Settings of the grid.
-"BuildGrid"  	: Creates a grid and set other basic settings.
-"BuildSwap"	: Enables swapping on the grid.
-"BuildMatch"	: Enables matching on the grid.
-"BuildMove"	: Move Elements on the grid make them fall. Emit elements.
